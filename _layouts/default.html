            Andorinha is a brazilian team from Colégio Técnico de Campinas (COTUCA) participating for the second time in the Land Rover 4x4 in Schools Challenge. The first year of participation was in the Development Class, but in 2017 the team is participating in the Professional Class.
            Brazil hosted for the first time in 2017 the National Finals, and it took place in Campinas, the city where we are from.  There, we got the second place among the professional teams, classifying us for the World Finals in Abu Dhabi. We also won the prizes for best visual identity and best verbal presentation among the professional teams.

            <!--Andorinha is a team that has knowledge in multiple areas, so the team's brand is 
            technology and new materials used to make the car, always taking care with the choices
            because of the environment.-->
            Andorinha's goal is to make something never tought of, something different than the 
            usual things that come to mind when you think about a 4x4 vehicle.
            Instead of making a normal 4x4 body shell, with a squared format, the team designed
            a new concept for a off-road vehicle: something transitioning between the modern and 
            the "wild", comming up with a car similar to the Land Rover Evoque, one of the only
            Land Rover cars produced in Brazil. <br>
            Besides the look, the team's vehicle also contains some technological materials in its
            composition, such as carbon fiber and different techniques with 3D printing, used to 
            create new parts for the vehicle. The team manufactured a lot of components, but many of
            them have also been improved.
